# Log configuration file
#
# This file controls the amount of logging output
# generated by various classes or methods.
#
# The different logging levels are
#
#   DEBUG
#   DEBUG3
#   DEBUG2
#   DEBUG1
#   INFO
#   WARN
#   ERROR
#   FATAL
#   NOTHING
#
# The setting 'level' controls the overall level of
# logging output. This means if you want to enable
# logging in a particular class you must set level
# to that level or lower.
#
# The setting 'classname' controls whether the entire
# class is printed in the log statements or just the
# method name.
#
# The logging is designed to have a low impact on
# performance of the program, and can be configured
# at run time by means of this file.
